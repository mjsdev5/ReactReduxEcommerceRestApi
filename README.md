# Introduction
This shopping cart application is built using React + Redux, it is supposed to work with any of these servers listed below. **Be warned** that
while making this app I am using this [Spring Boot Server](https://github.com/melardev/SpringBootEcommerceApiJersey) so I strongly encourage you
to use that as well, all the other servers worked from postman, but I don't know If they return in the response something called differently that
this redux app can not read, so if this redux app does not work, that is the reason, just a typo in a response variable, let me know about any typos
in any of the server apps and I will try to fix it.
